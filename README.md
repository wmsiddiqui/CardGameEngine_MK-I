# CardGameEngine_MK-I
Card Game Engine Architecture phase

Notes:
Program to interfaces, not objects. This will really help in creating unit tests.

Don't design concrete classes first.

First design the architecture by using interfaces. Fleshing out abstract classes should be relatively straightforward then.
Concrete classes will be even easier.

First, we should assume we will be getting a collection of UNSORTED commands or interactions, and we then need to execute them.

I expect better orgainization this time around in regards to namespaces.

TODO: Read up more on creational design patterns, see if we can leveredge any. Abstract Factory seems uneeded, along with Singleton.

See Factory, Builder, and Prototype.
